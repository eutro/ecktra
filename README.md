# Ecktra

![logo](logo.svg)

Easily extensible, expressive audio visualization in Racket.

# Usage

Ecktra is currently in development, and so documentation and such is severely lacking.

Ecktra uses a domain specific language (DSL) based on typed Racket.
Each program in this DSL represents an *audio visualizer*.

Examples can be found in the [examples](examples/) directory.
